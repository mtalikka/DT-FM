## digihealth

`diagnostics/digihealth/` is a locally modified copy of
[irpina/digihealth](https://github.com/irpina/digihealth), commit
`72f0183383e67c3313146bf77df6f71dd7996a8f`, with its OS 1.54 port (`6d2a956`)
applied. It is
GPL-2.0-or-later, not MIT. Its full license is retained at
`diagnostics/digihealth/LICENSE`. The local change makes FAST AUDIO opt-in
instead of enabling it at boot. Its source is included so that the exact
diagnostic configuration used during hardware testing is reproducible.
